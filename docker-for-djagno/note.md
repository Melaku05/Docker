# What is Docker?
` Docker is a way to isolate an entire operating system via Linux containers which are a type
of virtualization.
`
```
with Docker you
simply share two files–a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file–and the developer can have
confidence that their local development environment is exactly the same as the rest of the team.
